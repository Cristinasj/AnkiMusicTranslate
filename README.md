# musicTranslateAddon
This is an Anki add-on for helping you ankify lyrics for learning languages using Anki and music. 

So far I am working on the basic functionality that can be found on the "beta" folder. 

# Ideas and improvements for future versions
- Change the answer typing field to just avobe the clozed part of that card 
- Change colors fonts for both languages 
- Keep the maximum number of words to write at 6. Separate the verses by commas or dots
