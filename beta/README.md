# Beta release

This is a beta release with the basic funtionality that I will use untill I learn how to make a proper addon. 

I hope it is usefull for you as well. If you have any question, don't hesitate to open an issue. I'll be glad to help. 

It checks if two lines are the same so they are the same cloze

## Ideas to improve it 
- It ignores the lines with [] so they don't become a cloze 
- Given the lyrics, they get translated into your native language using google translate 
- Given the title and the artist, it finds the lyrics on its own looking int he most common lyrics sites (genius.com, metrolyrics.com...) 
- It gives you the option to download the song using youtube-dl and ask for the folder
